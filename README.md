# UnrealTesting
Mucking around with Unreal Engine

## Setup

1. Download and install Git - https://git-scm.com/downloads  
 - Recommended/default settings are fine.

2. Get a Github account - https://www.github.com/signup  
 - In Step 2, pick the "Free" plan, obviously.

3. Download and install Github for Windows - https://windows.github.com/  
 - If it fails, just run the installer again.
 - Once done, log in with your shiny, new Github account.
