# UnrealTesting
Mucking around with Unreal Engine

## Setup

1. Get Git  
 - https://git-scm.com/downloads
 - Recommended/default settings are fine.

2. Get a Github account  
 - https://www.github.com/signup  
 - In Step 2, pick the "Free" plan, obviously.

3. Get the Github app  
 - https://windows.github.com/  
 - If the install fails, just run it again.
 - Once done, log in with your shiny, new Github account.

4. Tell me your username so I can add you to the project

5. Grab a copy of the project  
 - https://github.com/Sunlis/UnrealTesting
 - Click the ["Clone in Desktop" button](http://i.imgur.com/WJkEn9q.png)
   - This should open up in the Github app and let you pull down the project
   - Even the "empty" project is about 1GB, so it might take a hot minute to pull it down

6. Change some shit in Unreal  
 - Don't forget to save

7. Sync your changes
 - In the Github app, you'll see something [like this](http://i.imgur.com/zRRndEE.png). Click it.
